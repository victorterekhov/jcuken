# Keyboard Layout Converter

This is a simple web application that helps users convert text typed using the wrong keyboard layout—between Russian and English (aka "ЙЦУКЕН" and "QWERTY" layouts).

For example:
- You meant to type: `hello world`
- But with the Russian layout on, you typed: `руддщ цщкдв`
- This tool converts it back to the intended English.

## 🚀 Features

- Convert between Russian ⬌ English keyboard layouts
- Brutalist-style minimal UI
- Copy converted text with a single click
- Trigger conversion via Enter key or button
- Instant feedback with tooltip

## 🛠️ Technologies

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- SVG icon for the copy button
- No external dependencies

## 📦 Usage

1. Paste your mistyped text into the input box.
2. Choose the direction of conversion (RU ➝ EN or EN ➝ RU).
3. Click **Convert** or press **Enter**.
4. Click the 📋 icon to copy the result.
